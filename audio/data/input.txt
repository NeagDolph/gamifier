Dear Meteor,

I hope this letter finds you well. It's been quite some time since our last encounter, and I wanted to reach out to you regarding the event that led to the extinction of my kind.

As a dinosaur, I must admit, we were quite tasty. We had succulent muscles and were seasoned just right. However, in all seriousness, I apologize for being too delicious. I know that it led to our demise, and it was not my intention.

I understand that you were just doing your job, but perhaps there could have been another way. Maybe some warning of sorts, or even giving us the opportunity to adapt would have been nice.

Nevertheless, I've come to terms with our fate and am at peace with it. I just wanted to express my thoughts and emotions to you, as we never got the chance to communicate.

Sincerely,
A Formerly Delicious Dinosaur
