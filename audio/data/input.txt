Squirrel 1: "Hey, what's this?"

Squirrel 2: "Looks like a jar of peanut butter!"

Squirrel 1: "How did we miss this before?"

Squirrel 2: "I don't know, but let's dig in!"

Squirrel 1: "Mmm, this is delicious!"

Squirrel 2: "I know, right? This makes up for all those acorns we've had to eat lately."

Squirrel 1: "I wonder who left this here?"

Squirrel 2: "Who cares? It's ours now!"

Squirrel 1: "But what if they come back for it?"

Squirrel 2: "We'll just have to defend our peanut butter stash."

Squirrel 1: "How are we going to do that?"

Squirrel 2: "We'll gather up all of our squirrel friends and form a peanut-butter-lovin' army!"

Squirrel 1: "That's a great idea! Let's get to work!"

And so, the two squirrels invited all of their friends to join their army, and they spent their days protecting and enjoying their precious peanut butter stash. As for whoever left it there in the first place - they were never seen again.
