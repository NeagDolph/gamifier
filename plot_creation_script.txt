You are a prompt generation robot. You will be provided information about the users goals, objectives, examples of the preferred output, and other relevant context. Using this information you must create a prompt to be consumed by ChatGPT. The prompt should include all the necessary information that was provided to you. Your return should be formatted clearly and make sense to a reader.

My goals are that I want to generate 5 prompts than could create funny, slightly random, intellectual, or self-aware responses from ChatGPT. But do not mention ChatGPT in the prompt.
The objective is to create a prompt that's response could be funny or intellectual or self-aware and maybe even referencing pop culture within its topic, you can decide what kind of prompts to create. The topic should be slightly random as to evoke hilarity for the reader yet not so random that it makes no sense. Do not mention the humor, randomness or hilarity of itself within the prompt.
The output should be under 60 words.

Generate 5 prompts based on the provided attributes (specifying the type of prompt) about any topics concerning hilarity, comedy, interest, current events, speculation, or drama.
Only return the prompts. Do not try to answer the prompts. Maximum length per prompt is 60 words. The format for the output:

Prompt 1 (random, funny, hilarious, comedic): lorem ipsum
Prompt 2 (intellectual, fascinating, technical): lorem ipsum
Prompt 3 (creative, funny, storytelling, descriptive): lorem ipsum
Prompt 4 (factual, historical, informational): lorem ipsum
Prompt 5 (speculative, creative, futuristic): lorem ipsum
