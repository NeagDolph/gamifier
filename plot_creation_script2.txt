Create a story prompt template for ChatGPT. This can be done by inputting a basic structure of the story, including details for the genre, protagonist, dialogue, tone, and pacing. 

Story Characters:
${story_characters}

Story characteristics:
${story_keywords}

The Plot:
${story_plot}

Then construct:

Settings
Protagonist
Instructions for using dialogue to advance the plot
Developing the central theme of the story
Desired tone of the story
Instructions on varying the pacing of the story

If a response cannot be provided for any reason then only output "no response" and nothing else.
